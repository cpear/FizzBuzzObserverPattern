# FizzBuzzObserverPattern
Example of the Observer Pattern implemented with Fizz Buzz

This is a hand rolled implementation of the Observer Pattern. 

The code comes with one observer called "Counter" who tracks some simple stats. 

The caller (Console App) implements its own observer called "Writer" for dumping the FizzBuzz results to the console window.
